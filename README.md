# Navigation between SwiftUI views and UIKit views #

It is easy to navigate between views in SwiftUI. It is fairly easy to navigate between views in UIKit. However, it is not that easy to navigate between SwiftUI and UIKit and back again. This project shows how it can be done.

# The Project

1. A SwiftUI View where the navigation is initialized. Clicking a button in this SwiftUI environment triggers:
2. A UIKitViewController where a few names are listed. Clicking one of the names in this UIKit environment triggers:
3. Another SwiftUI View where the full names are shown.
