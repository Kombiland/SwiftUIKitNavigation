# Navigation between SwiftUI views and UIKit views #

It is easy to navigate between views in SwiftUI. It is fairly easy to navigate between views in UIKit. However, it is not that easy to navigate between SwiftUI and UIKit and back again. This project shows how it can be done.

# The Project

This app consists of: 

1. A SwiftUI View where the navigation is initialized.
2. A UIKitViewController where a few names are listed.
3. Another SwiftUI View where the full names are shown.
